(he's an angry bird)

## why
cardinal keeps track of your stream and tells you the cardinality of it

## how
you define a time duration (ie. 1 min) and add items.  cardinal will give you a cardinality estimate in the form of a float representing the percentage of your stream that is unique

## why again?
tracking the cardinality of streams enables smarter anomaly detection and response
